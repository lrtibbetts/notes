Misc web APIs

- [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
- [Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)
	- [Window.sesionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)
		- similar to `localStorage`. the difference is data in `sessionStorage` is cleared when the page sesion ends
		- when a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that tab
		- the session lasts as long as the tab/browser is open, and survives over page reloads, restores
- [History](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)
	- the `history` object exposes methods/properties that let you navigate back and forth through a user's history
