##### Static vs dynamic sites
- A static website is made up of a fixed number of pre-built files stored on a web server. When a user requests a page via a URL, the server returns the HTML specified by the URL and any accompanying CSS and/or JS files
- Dynamic websites: the web server builds HTML files on-the-fly. When the user requests a page, the server pulls information from one or more databases and constructs the HTML


##### Server-side vs client-side rendering
- Server-side rendering (SSR) means the server generates a complete HTML page in response to a URL request
- Client-side rendering means the browser will run JavaScript code to generate the HTML content


##### Single-page application (SPA)
- A web app implementation that loads only a single web document
- The current web page is rewritten with new data from the server, instead of the default method where the web browser loads entire new pages.
